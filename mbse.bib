  abstract = {Understanding the link between health and place can strengthen the design of health interventions, particularly in the context of HIV prevention. Individuals who might one day participate in such interventions \textendash{} including youth \textendash{} may further improve the design if engaged in a meaningful way in the formative research process. Increasingly, participatory mapping methods are being used to achieve both aims. We describe the development of three innovative mapping methods for engaging youth in formative community-based research: `dot map' focus groups, geocaching games, and satellite imagery-assisted daily activity logs. We demonstrate that these methods are feasible and acceptable in a low-resource, rural African setting. The discussion outlines the merits of each method and considers possible limitations.},

  abstract = {Associations between individual- and family-level psychosocial factors and sexual behavior were examined among 325 adolescents ages 10\textendash{}18 in rural Kenya. History of sexual activity was reported by 51\% of males and 30\% of females. Among those reporting sex within the past year, 64\% of males and 32\% of females had multiple partners; 85\% of males and 54\% of females reported not using a condom at last sex. Multivariate logistic regression modeling demonstrated sexually active adolescents were significantly more likely to be older, male, more accepting of risky behavior, and have greater perceived HIV risk, caregiver social support, social support related to HIV, and emotional problems. Youths reporting high-risk behavior (unprotected sex or multiple partners) were significantly more likely to be younger, male, and have lower sex-related self-efficacy, lower caregiver monitoring, and more externalizing problems. Future studies should evaluate HIV prevention interventions targeting improvements in mental health and family relationships.},
