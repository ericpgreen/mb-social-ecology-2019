This is the data and code repository for the paper, "Is social-ecological risk associated with individual HIV risk beliefs and behaviours?: An analysis of Kenyan adolescents' local communities and activity spaces". Pre-print [here](https://osf.io/gyxmz).

The data in this repository is a **synthetic dataset** based on the raw study data. We used the `synthpop` package for R to create this dataset due to concerns about the potential to identify participants. As a synthetic dataset, this means that running the files here will not fully reproduce the pre-print results.
